# Random notes

This section contains notes that I made that are either incompelte or not fully formatted and formulated out yet.

## Random older notes

Major:
- Major scale: W W H W W W H
- Major scale: Maj Min Min Maj Maj Min Dim
- Maj: Root/ Major 3rd/ Perfect 5th OR Root/ Major 3rd, on top of that Minor 3rd
- GMaj: Maj third (4 semitones) + minor third (three semi tones) --> Maj third + perfect fifth (7 semitones)
- AMin: Min third (4 semitones) + major third (three semi tones) --> Min third + perfect fifth (7 semitones)
- Maj7: Maj Chord as base, and 11 semitones/ one semitone below octave/ Maj third on top of perfect fifth

Minor:
- Minor scale: W H W W H W W
- Minor scale: Min Dim Maj Min Min Maj Maj
- Min: Root/ Minor 3rd/ Perfect 5th OR Root/ Minor 3rd, on top of that Major 3rd
- Min7: Min Chord as base, and 10 semitones/ two semitones below octave/ Min third on top of perfect fifth

Same pattern with Maj7 Min7 Min7 Maj7 7 Min7 Min7b5

Minor scale to relative major scale: 3rd note of minor scale because of the overflow over Locrian back to ionian

For every mode, find the relative major mode. Now, for that major mode, find the 3 minor chords. The minor pentatonics of those chords should sound OK over the original mode, depending on context

Major modes: Ionian/ Lydian/ Mixolydian
Minor modes: Aeolian/ Dorian/ Phrygian/ Locrian
--> Classified based on their 3rd scale degree: Only 3 semitones from root to 3rd note in scale for minor scales

e.g. Dim: Root/ Minor Third/ Dim Fifth (Six instead of 7 semitones) OR Root/ Minor 3rd/ Minor 3rd on top of Minor 3rd

e.g. Dim7: Diminished 7th above the root (9 semitones above the root) OR again Minor 3rd on top of last Minor 3rd // 3 semitones below octave
--> Only in harmonic minor scales

Min7b5: half-diminished
root + minor third + diminished fifth + minor seventh --> Diminished chord + minor 7th (10 semitones above root)/ two semitones below octave/ Min third on top of diminished fifth
---> Can only be constructed from diminshed chords on, meaning that key contains one or none?
---> Only in locrian as it is the 1st degree there? What about the other modes?

e.g. Dom7th chords: Major Chord base with flat 7th on top/ 2 semitones below octave of root --> 'simple' 7th chords
--> How important is Dom 7th? Only in Mixolydian/ for Mixolydian sound?

maj7#5: only harmonic minor
minmaj7: only harmonic minor


## Finding more chords fitting to mode-specific vamp

In order to find more chords here:
Take 4th & 5th chord of relative major scale + root of original scale in bass. Next, for those 2 major chords, find the 2 relativ minor chords (3 semitones below). Those will sound OK as well.
Additionally, take the chord that defines the sound of the scale:
- Ionian:      Major 3rd/ 7th         // 3rd and 7th scale degree
- Dorian:      Major 6th              // 6th scale degree
- Phrygian:    Flat 2nd scale degree  // 2nd scale degree
- Lydian:      Raised 4th             // 4th scale degree
- Mixolydian:  Flattened 7th          // 7th scale degree
- Aeolian:							// 6th?
- Locrian:     Flattened 5th  		// 5th scale degree



Does that mean a e.g. Phrygian chord progression should consist of 4th & 5th chord of relative major scale (--> 2 major chords making it 'Phrygian' with original root in bass) + second degree chords?
(thanks google, 2nd degree is lowered in phrygian) Question: (AbMaj is already the 2nd degree)?
e.g. in G Phrygian:
GMin/ AbMaj/ GMin/ BbMaj  // GMin/ FMin/ GMin/ GMin

Notes:   G     Ab     Bb     C     D       Eb     F   G
Chords:  GMin7 AbMaj7 BbDom7 CMin7 Dmin7b5 EbMaj7 FMin7


- Tonic (1st degree): The home note that gives the scale its identity and acts as a point of resolution.
- Supertonic (2nd degree): The note that creates movement away from the tonic.
- Mediant (3rd degree): Defines the scale's quality as major or minor.
- Subdominant (4th degree): Leads towards the dominant and creates tension that can resolve to the tonic.
- Dominant (5th degree): Creates strong tension that strongly pulls back to the tonic. It is a key note for creating resolution.
- Submediant (6th degree): Adds emotional depth and is often used in relative minor relationships.
- Leading tone (7th degree): A note a half step below the tonic that has a powerful pull to resolve to the tonic

Does that mean a e.g. Locrian chord progression should consist of 4th & 5th chord of relative major scale (--> 2 major chords making it 'Locrian' with original root in bass) + first degree chords?
(reasoning being is that the 1st degree is the diminished, which is quite unusual)
e.g. in G Locrian:
GDim/ DbMaj/ GDim/ EbMaj
GDim/ BbMin/ GDim/ CMin


Does that mean a e.g. Dorian chord progression should consist of 4th & 5th chord of relative major scale (--> 2 major chords making it 'Dorian' with original root in bass) + sixth degree chords?
e.g. in G Dorian:
Relative F Major scale : F  G  A  Bb  C  D  E  F
GMin/ BbMaj/ EDim/ CMaj
EDim/ GMin/ GMin/ AMin


Does that mean a e.g. Aeolian chord progression should consist of 4th & 5th chord of relative major scale (--> 2 major chords making it 'Aeolian' with original root in bass) + 1st degree chord?
e.g. in G Aeolian:
GMin/ EbMaj/ GMin/ FMaj

--> You just have to look at the chords:
| Major Chords - Flat                                | Major Chords                                   | Major Chords - Sharp                              |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ----- SAME AS B MAJOR -----                        | CMaj: C - E  - G   --> (Em  - G)  relationship | C#Maj: C# - F  - G#  --> (Fm  - G#)  relationship |
| DbMaj: Db - F  - Ab   --> (Fm - Ab)   relationship | DMaj: D - F# - A   --> (F#m - A)  relationship | D#Maj: D# - G  - A#  --> (Gm  - A#)  relationship |
| EbMaj: Eb - G  - Bb   --> (Gm - Bb)   relationship | EMaj: E - G# - B   --> (G#m - B)  relationship | ----- SAME AS F MAJOR -----                       |

| GbMaj: Gb - Bb - Db   --> (Bbm  - Db) relationship | GMaj: G - B  - D   --> (Bm  - D)  relationship | G#Maj: G# - C  - D#  --> (Cm  - D#)  relationship |
| AbMaj: Ab - C  - Eb   --> (Cm - Eb)   relationship | AMaj: A - C# - E   --> (C#m - E)  relationship | A#Maj: A# - D  - F   --> (Dm  - F)   relationship |
| BbMaj: Bb - D  - F    --> (Dm - F)    relationship | BMaj: B - D# - F#  --> (D#m - F#) relationship | ----- SAME AS C MAJOR -----                       |


---> music is in DbMinor, and the relative major is needed.
What Major Chord has 'D' as its 3rd? --> B - D# - F# --> realtive major to D# is F# --> Flatten twice --> Db <-> E

| Minor Chords      |
|-------------------|
| CMin: C - Eb  - G |
| DMin: D - F - A   |
| EMin: E - G - B   |
| FMin: F - Ab  - C |
| GMin: G - Bb  - D |
| AMin: A - C - E   |
| BMin: B - D - F#  |

Minor Chords = Major Chords with 3rd semitone down


## Trying to figure out all 7th chords in a key

- DMaj7: D Major: D  E  F#  G  A  B  C#  D: DF#AC#: C# not in G Major: Therefor not in key

Minor:
- AMin7: A Minor: A  B   C  D  E  F  G  A: ACEG:  G to A is whole tone, and G in G Major: In Key --> Rel Major Key: C Major: C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C: Start at A and build A + min third + perf fith + min 7th
- BMin7: B Minor: B  C#  D  E  F# G  A  B: BDF#A: A in G Major: In Key (Relative major key: C# Locrian -> D IONIAN/ MAJOR -> E Dorian -> ...)
